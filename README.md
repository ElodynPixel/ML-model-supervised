Where supervised Machine learning models will be tested
Supervised Machine learning can be divided into calssification model and a regression model.
##The regression model involves 4 steps
  Preparing the data
  Training the model
  Evaluating the performance
    MAE
    RMSE
    RSE
    RAE
    R2
  Deploy a predictive service
    Inference pipeline
    Deployment
      Endpoint
      Test
      Consume
   The compute instances that exists for a regression model is as follow:
   	Compute Instance
    	Compute Cluster
     	Inference cluster
      	Attached compute
  
##The Classification model involves 4 steps
  Prepare data
  Train model
  Evaluate performance
    1. Confusion matrix
      False Positive
      True Positive
      False Negative
      True Negative
	  2. Choosing a threshold
	  3. ROC curve and AUC metric
  Deploy a predictive service
    1. Inference pipeline
	  2. Deployment
